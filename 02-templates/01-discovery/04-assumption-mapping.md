## Assumption Table

| Assumption | Type | Risk Level (Low/Med/High) | Evidence | Next Step |
|----------|------|--------------------------|---------|----------|
|          |      |                          |         |          |

## Notes
- High-risk assumptions should be tested first
- Unvalidated assumptions are risks, not facts
