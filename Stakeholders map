What is stakeholder mapping?
A stakeholder map is a visual representation of individuals or groups with a vested interest in a project, product, or idea. Stakeholder mapping helps you identify these key stakeholders, understand their influence, and develop a strategy for stakeholder management.
Depending on your project, your list of stakeholders might include clients, collaborators, project owners, or even end-users of a product.
